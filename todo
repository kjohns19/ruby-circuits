Get selector to put components in order based on creation time
   For example, logic gates should be in this order: And, Or, XOr, Nand, Nor, XNor, Not, Mux, DeMux
   This currently works for component classes that use BinaryOperator.create or Function.create
   It does not work correctly for regular class definitions (class NewComp < Component ...)

Change properties around. I don't like the complicated properties method in Component
   Not really necessary, I think it works correctly now, it just seems messy
   Kind of fixed? It looks a bit nicer at least.

Get component editor to save values when you switch to a different component
   Have it store an instance for each class and use the property getters/setters to save the values
