Get selector to put components in order based on creation time
   For example, logic gates should be in this order: And, Or, XOr, Nand, Nor, XNor, Not, Mux, DeMux
   This currently works for component classes that use BinaryOperator.create or Function.create
   It does not work correctly for regular class definitions (class NewComp < Component ...)

Change properties around. I don't like the complicated properties method in Component
   Not really necessary, I think it works correctly now, it just seems messy
